class Constraint(metaclass=ABCMeta):
    """
    Abstract constraint class used for typing. Relations in the relation graph
    (i.e. edges of the graph) define constraints which a position of an object
    must meet. These constraints are defined by binary functions (or callable
    objects) R^2 â†’ {T, F} which for given coordinates return whether the
    constraint is satisfied.

    When placing an object a set of randomly generated points is produced. These
    points are tested and if a points meets all the constraints then it is used
    as a position of the object. If none of the generated points meets all the
    constraints then a point with the most of constraints satisfied is used as
    a position.
