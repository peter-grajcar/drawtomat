Text-to-image generators have improved significantly with the recent development of deep neural networks. However, generating complex scenes with multiple objects and relations still remains a difficult problem. In this thesis, we implement a text-to-drawing generator using scene graphs as an intermediate structure. We focus on determining object size and position given a scene graph. We propose a rule-based and classifier-based approach to determine the object position and multiple approaches for size extraction from the scene graph dataset. We provide details of our implementation. We compare and evaluate our approaches and present the results. Finally, we propose potential future use in photorealistic text-to-image generation.
