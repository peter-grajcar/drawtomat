In this thesis, we have developed a command-line and a web-based application that generates drawings from a textual description using scene graphs as an intermediate structure. We have proposed various approaches for determining the sizes and positions of objects in a scene based on their relations in the scene graph. We have shown that our proposed approach, in many cases, can generate drawings that correspond to the description. 

\medskip

Our approach may find their use in layout generation, used by some photorealistic image generators  \citep{zhao2019image}.  Photorealistic image generators that generate images using the scene graphs currently use box regression networks for this task \citep{johnson2018image,tripathi2019using}. Our approach could be an alternative to the box regression method. However, comparison with the box regression networks is beyond the scope of this thesis, and it may be a subject of future work.
